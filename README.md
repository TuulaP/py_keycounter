# py_keycounter

Simple keycounter (counts all keyboard presses and stores them to local file)

Original from  : https://github.com/omad/KeyCounter

Quick changes to PyQt6 and works with python 3.10  (windows)


## Requirements


pip install PyQt6

pip install pyWinhook



## Get it started when computer starts

Windows + R  and taskschd.msc  to start task scheduler. (It might be nifty to add a .bat file (python py_keycounter.py ) , to add just that .bat file to scheduler.
